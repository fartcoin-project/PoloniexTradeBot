    # Token to use GitHub API. It must have "repo" and "workflow" scopes so it can push to repo and edit workflows. It cannot be the default GitHub Actions token GITHUB_TOKEN. GitHub Action token's permissions are limited to the repository that contains your workflows. Provide token of the user that has rights to push to the repos that this action is suppose to update. 

    github_token: 
    # The username (not display name) of the committer that will be used in the commit of changes in the workflow file in specific repository. In the format `web-flow`.

    committer_username: # optional, default is web-flow

    commit_message: # optional, default is Update global workflows
    # Comma-separated list of file paths or directories that should be handled by this action and updated in other repositories. This option is useful if you use "patterns_to_include" with large amount of files, and some of them you want to ignore. In the format `./github/workflows/another_file.yml`.

    patterns_to_ignore: 
    # Comma-separated list of file paths or directories that should be handled by this action and updated in other repositories. In the format `.github/workflows`.

    patterns_to_include: 
    # Comma-separated list of repositories that should not get updates from this action. Action already ignores the repo in which the action is triggered so you do not need to add it explicitly. In the format `repo1,repo2`.

    repos_to_ignore: # optional
    # Comma-separated list of topics that should get updates from this action.  Repos that do not contain one of the specified topics will get appended to the repos_to_ignore list.  In the format topic1,topic2.

    # Boolean value on whether to exclude private repositories from this action.

    exclude_private: # optional

    # By default, action creates branch from default branch and opens PR only against default branch. With this property you can override this behaviour. You can provide a comma-separated list of branches this action shoudl work agains. You can also provide regex, but without comma as list of branches is split in code by comma.

    branches: # optional
    # Name of the directory where all files matching "patterns_to_include" will be copied. In the format `.github/workflows`.

    destination: # optional
